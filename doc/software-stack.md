Software stack
##############

Let's avoid unexpected troubles by using same stacks in dev and prod environments...

VM Hosting stack
================

The VM we are using for development is built on top of:

* virtualbox 4.2.4
* vagrant 1.0.5

Target server requirements
==========================

* Chef-solo 10.16.2
* linux distro/release ? 
* 32 bit or 64 bit ?

Others
======

* vagrant plugin: veewee (0.3.1), *I think we could stay on master there...*
